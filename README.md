# 🖥️ Project: Ubuntu Server Hardening

## 1. Distribution Choice

Ubuntu Server LTS was chosen as the Linux distribution for this project.

### 🟢 Ubuntu Server LTS — Recommended

Why it makes sense:

- Most widely used Linux server in:
  - enterprises
  - cloud environments
  - security labs
- Extensive and up-to-date documentation
- Frequent security updates
- Modern defaults already enabled
- Demonstrates market-relevant knowledge to recruiters

In the context of this project:

- Hardening on Ubuntu = transferable to other environments
- Recognizable to recruiters
- Balanced control and practicality

## 2. Next Steps After Choosing

1. Download the ISO
   - Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (official image)
2. Create the VM
   - 2 vCPU
   - 2–4 GB RAM
   - 20–30 GB disk
   - Network: NAT (temporary)

---

## 3. VM Installation

### 3.1 Storage Configuration

File System Summary:

| MOUNT POINT | SIZE   | TYPE          |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| /           | 22.996G | ext4 (LVM)   |
| /boot       | 2.000G  | ext4         |

Devices:

- ubuntu-vg → LVM volume group (22.996G)
- ubuntu-lv → logical volume mounted at /

Installation completed:

```
Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS sry-hardening-01 tty1

## 4. Verify Essential Services

### 4.1 SSH

Command:

```
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Expected output:

```
ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; preset: enabled)
Active: active (running)
```

If SSH is not active:

```
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

---

## 5. Test Network Connectivity

### 5.1 Check IP Address

Command:

```
ip a
```

Interpretation:

- Network interface is active
- IP address assigned (example: 10.0.2.15/24)
- IPv6 present, loopback OK

### 5.2 Internet Connectivity Test

Initial command:

```
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

Common issue: ping is not installed by default on Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS

Solution:

```
sudo apt install iputils-ping -y
```

Test after installation:

```
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

Expected output:

```
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=6.06 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=7.04 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=6.82 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=7.06 ms
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
```

Conclusion:

- Packets sent and r
